        Getting started on hardware development or want to make your own project? 
        Need something to put on your resume? IEEE's Quarterly Projects aims to provide
         students with project experience in a span of 10 weeks. During QP, students 
         will acquire skills used in the industry such as C++ and the prototyping process
        with the assistance of our mentors. At the end of the quarter, students will 
        demonstrate their projects at QP Showcase in front of other students, professors, 
        and industry professionals!
