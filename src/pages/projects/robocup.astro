        text="UC San Diego’s RoboCup team is one of IEEE’s largest projects. Different subteams come together to build 6 autonomous soccer-playing robots to compete in the international RoboCup Small Sized League Competition every year. TritonBots FC is UCSD’s RoboCup Small-Size League Team. Students develop fully autonomous soccer playing robots. All hardware is custom built and software programmed from the ground up. Position, velocity, and field data is  received in real time through computer vision."
